## Getting Started
We recommend you work on the changes in your local environment because most of the contribution process requires you to do so rather than directly on GitHub.

### 1. Fork the repository

Click the `fork` button at the top of the front page. <br>
Forking is a process to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account. You always want to remember to fork a repository before cloning it.

### 2. Clone the repository in your local machine

Clone a repository means copying the remote repository into your local machine.

#### On GitHub

1. Click your profile picture on the right top.
2. Click "Your repositories".
3. Open the forked repo by clicking on it.
4. Click the green `<> Code` button.
5. Click the copy icon to copy the HTTPS URL.

#### On your local machine

1. In your terminal, run this command to create a copy of the forked repository in your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https_url
   ```

   Change the `https_url` with the HTTPS link that you've copied.

2. Navigate to the directory where your local repository lives.

   ```bash
   cd linkplant
   ```

Remember that you always want to work on and push your changes into the forked repository, not the original one.
